# Game_SDL_project
  This is a project about horror game using SDL. Players have the task of controlling death to destroy the enemy and get the highest score. Each time you play, there will be 5 lives. And when 5 lives are over, the game will end. However you can click play again to improve the score. I hope you enjoy the game.

project source code)
